## ETL Milstone
1. **Environment Setting:** Using Google Colab IDE, download the source code from LearnOpencv's article "Understanding Multiple Object Tracking using DeepSORT".
2. **Read the Paper and Watch the video** To understand DeepSORT's architecture, draw the architecture diagram and write down the key components.
3. **Git clone yolov5 and DeepSORT:** Git clone the library.
4. **Fix code:** The source code is deprecated everywhere.
   1. The TensorFlow version is incompatible. (import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf)
   2. linear_assignment should be imported from scipy.optimize. 
   3. yolov5 is the wrong version. (use v6.2)
   4. np.int and np.float are not clear expressions. (detection.py)
   5. download model data mars-small128.pb to (model_data)
   6. revise min_cost_matching function to solve tuple indices error (linear_assignment.py)
